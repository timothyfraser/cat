# CAT Platform User Documentation

Welcome to the **CAT (Climate Action in Transportation) Platform**! This documentation will help you navigate and use the platform to analyze transportation emissions data for your planning and analysis needs.

## What is the CAT Platform?

The CAT Platform is a web-based platform that helps transportation planners, air quality analysts, and conformity analysts estimate and analyze transportation emissions. The platform provides:

- **Emissions Modeling**: Submit orders to run MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator) models for your geographic areas
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive charts and maps of emissions data
- **Scenario Analysis**: Estimate how emissions change when you adjust transportation activity
- **Report Generation**: Create professional Word document reports for presentations and documentation
- **Data Access**: Download emissions data in bulk or view it through interactive tools

## Quick Start

1. **[Create an Account](getting-started.md#creating-your-account)** - Sign up for a free account
2. **[Create Your First Order](creating-orders.md)** - Submit an emissions modeling order for a county
3. **[View Your Results](viewing-orders.md)** - Check order status and download data
4. **[Visualize Your Data](visualizer-guide.md)** - Explore your results with interactive charts and maps

## Platform Overview

### Core Features

**Order Management (Cloud MOVES)**
- **[Creating Orders](creating-orders.md)**: Submit emissions modeling requests for specific counties and years through Cloud MOVES
- **[Viewing Orders](viewing-orders.md)**: Track order status, download results, and manage your data from Cloud MOVES
- **[Publishing Data](publishing-data.md)**: Share verified results to the public CAT Grand Database

**Analysis Tools**
- **[Visualizer](visualizer-guide.md)**: Interactive charts, maps, and visualizations of emissions data
- **[Calculator](calculator-guide.md)**: Estimate emissions changes by adjusting activity measures (VMT, vehicle counts, etc.)
- **[Reporter](reporter-guide.md)**: Generate professional Word document reports with charts and data
- **[Aggregator](aggregator-guide.md)**: Compare emissions data across multiple counties side-by-side
- **[Data Hub](data-hub-guide.md)**: Download large datasets in bulk from the CAT Grand Database

**Advanced Features**
- **[Translators](translators-guide.md)**: Edit MOVES input tables for custom modeling scenarios
- **[Sharing & Collaboration](sharing-collaboration.md)**: Share your orders with colleagues and manage access

## Understanding the Platform

### What is an "Order"?

An **order** is a request to run emissions modeling for a specific geographic area (county) and year through the **Cloud MOVES** system. Cloud MOVES is the distributed computing infrastructure that processes MOVES emissions calculations. When you create an order:

1. You select a county (using FIPS code or county name) and year
2. Optionally, you can upload custom MOVES input files to customize the modeling
3. Cloud MOVES processes your order (typically takes 5-10 minutes)
4. Results are available for download and visualization

### Geographic Areas

The platform uses **FIPS codes** (Federal Information Processing Standards) to identify counties. For example:
- Tompkins County, NY = FIPS code 36109
- Los Angeles County, CA = FIPS code 06037

You can search by county name or enter the FIPS code directly.

### Data Sources

- **Your Orders**: Custom emissions modeling results from your submitted orders
- **CAT Grand Database**: Publicly available emissions data from verified published orders
- **Default MOVES Data**: Standard activity and emissions factors used in calculations
