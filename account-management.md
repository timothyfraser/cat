## Understanding Subscriptions

### Subscription Tiers

The platform offers different subscription levels:

### Subscription Limits

Each subscription tier has limits on:

- **Total Orders**: Maximum number of orders in your account (some tiers have unlimited)

You can see your current usage on the New Order page:
- Orders this month: X / Y
- Total orders: X / Y

If you reach your limit, you'll need to:
- Wait until next month (for monthly limits)
- Upgrade your subscription (for more capacity)
- Delete old orders (if you've reached total limit)

## Verification for Publishing

### What is Verification?

**Verification** allows you to publish your order results to the public CAT Grand Database. This makes your data available to other users and the public.

### Why Get Verified?

- Share your organization's emissions data publicly
- Contribute to the CAT Grand Database
- Make your data available for regional analysis
- Support transparency in transportation planning

### Requesting Verification

1. On the Account page, scroll to the **"Verification"** section
2. Enter the following:
   - **Geoid (FIPS Code)**: The 5-digit FIPS code for the county you want to publish (e.g., 36109 for Tompkins County, NY)
   - **Email**: Your work email address (must be .gov or .edu domain)
3. Click **"Submit Verification"**

> **Important**: Your email must have a .gov or .edu domain to be eligible for verification. This ensures that only government and educational institutions can publish public data.

### Verification Process

1. **Submit Request**: Your verification request is submitted
2. **Review Period**: Platform administrators review your request (typically 1-2 business days)
3. **Approval/Rejection**: You'll be notified of the decision
4. **Publishing Access**: Once approved, you can publish orders for that geographic area

### Viewing Verified Areas

On the Account page, the **"Verified Areas"** section shows:
- A table of all counties (geoids) for which you are verified
- County name and state
- Verification status

Once verified for a county, you can publish any order for that county to the public database.

### Publishing Verified Data

After verification, you can publish your orders:
1. Go to **"View Orders"**
2. Select the order(s) you want to publish
3. Click **"PUBLISH"**
4. Confirm the publication
5. Your data will be available in the CAT Grand Database within 5-10 minutes

For detailed instructions, see **[Publishing Data](publishing-data.md)**.
