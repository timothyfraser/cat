# Glossary

Definitions of key terms and concepts used in the CAT Platform.

## A

**Aggregation Level**
- How data is grouped or categorized (e.g., by vehicle type, fuel type, road type)
- Used in visualizations and reports to show breakdowns

## C

**CAT (Climate Action in Transportation)**
- The overall platform and organization providing emissions analysis tools

**CO2e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent)**
- A measure that expresses the impact of different greenhouse gases in terms of CO2
- Used to compare emissions from different sources

**County**
- A geographic area identified by a FIPS code
- The primary geographic unit for emissions modeling in the platform

## D

**Data Hub**
- Tool for bulk downloading emissions data for multiple counties and years

**Donut Chart**
- A circular chart (like a pie chart with a hole in the center)
- Used in Reporter to show distributions and proportions

## E

**Emissions**
- Pollutants released into the atmosphere
- Measured in various units depending on the pollutant

**Emission Factors**
- Standard rates used to calculate emissions from activity data
- Part of the MOVES model

## F

**FIPS Code**
- Federal Information Processing Standards code
- A 5-digit number that uniquely identifies a county
- Example: 36109 = Tompkins County, NY
- Also called "geoid"

## G

**Geoid**
- Another term for FIPS code
- The geographic identifier for a county
- Always 5 digits (may have leading zeros)

**Granddata / CAT Grand Database**
- The public database of published emissions data
- Contains data from verified users who have published their orders
- Accessible to all users

## M

**Metric**
- A type of measurement or data point
- Common metrics: Emissions, VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), Vehicles

**MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator)**
- EPA's model for estimating emissions from on-road vehicles
- The platform uses MOVES to calculate emissions from activity data

**MPO (Metropolitan Planning Organization)**
- Regional transportation planning organizations
- Common users of the CAT Platform

## O

**Order**
- A request to run emissions modeling for a specific county and year
- When you submit an order, the system runs MOVES and generates results
- Takes 5-10 minutes to process

**Orderdata**
- Data from your custom orders (as opposed to public granddata)
- Your own modeling results

## P

**Pollutant**
- A substance released into the atmosphere
- Common pollutants: CO2e, CO (carbon monoxide), NOx (nitrogen oxides), PM (particulate matter)

**Publishing**
- Making your order results publicly available in the CAT Grand Database
- Requires verification for the county
- Permanent action (cannot be undone)

## R

**Regulatory Class**
- Vehicle classification for regulatory purposes
- Examples: Light Duty Vehicles, Medium Duty Vehicles, Heavy Duty Vehicles

**Road Type**
- Classification of roads
- Categories: Rural/Urban, Restricted/Unrestricted Access

## S

**Scenario**
- A set of assumptions or conditions for analysis
- In Calculator, you create scenarios by adjusting activity measures

**Source Type**
- Vehicle type category
- Examples: Motorcycles, Passenger Cars, Light Trucks, Heavy Trucks, Buses

**Subscription**
- Your account tier (Free, Basic, Premium, Institutional)
- Determines order limits and features available

## V

**Verification**
- Process to authorize publishing data for a specific county
- Requires .gov or .edu email address
- Must be approved by platform administrators

**VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)**
- Total miles driven by all vehicles
- A key activity measure in emissions modeling

**Vehicle Type**
- Category of vehicle (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, etc.)
- Used to break down emissions and activity data
